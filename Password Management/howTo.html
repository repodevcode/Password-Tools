Password management is really important. It helps remember your passwords.
</br>
Some people don't know how to do that. That's why I created this site - to help them! 
</br>
Before, I had trouble managing passwords: where to put them, how to design that paper.
</br>
Now, that I found an awesome orginizer my passwords are safe, and orginized. Today, i'll share that orginizer with you.
<br>
<a href="https://www.thepurplepumpkinblog.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/password-reminder-printable_blue.png">Sheet (click here to open it)</a>
That worksheet really helped me. Remember to keep your passwords in a safe place and DO NOT keep your password sheet outdated.
</br>
DO NOT use that sheet on computer. PRINT IT OUT.
<br>
<p> And that's all you need to know about password management. Good Luck! </p>
